= Copyright Tools

== Available Tools

=== tools/update_copyright_year.py
Use the name provided by --copyright-name to find the appropriate copyright
line and update its year.

    update_copyright_year.py --copyright-name "Sean Perry" *.py

Will find a line like:

    # Copyright (c) 2015 Sean Perry

and update it to be:

    # Copyright (c) 2015-2016 Sean Perry

Only comment lines are checked. Right now the assumption is that '#' or ';'
marks a comment.

=== helpers/pre-review
This is a hook intended for use with 'git review'. Put it in ~/.config/git-review/hooks/pre-review and chmod +x it. This will run update_copyright_year on all
of the files in the current commit that is about to be reviewed.

== Hacking
